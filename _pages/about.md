👩🏻‍💻 I am a year 3 Infomation Engineering and Media student in Nanyang Technological University.

🐨 I'm currently waiting to go on exchange in UNSW next semester and I can't wait to immerse myself in their culture and experience the unique teaching styles they offer. 

🔎 My interests lie in cybersecurity, cloud programming, and AI. Really excited to see what more AI can achieve in the future and how it may potentially affect our lives.

Participated in Capture The Flag hosted by DSTA Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp. In the camp, we learnt about different operating systems, types of cybersecurity threats (Social Engineering, Ransomware, DDos, Cryptojacking) and ways to protect our data from intruders such as using Cryptology.
