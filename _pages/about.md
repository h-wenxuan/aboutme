👩🏻‍💻 I am a year 3 Infomation Engineering and Media student in Nanyang Technological University.

🐨 I'm currently waiting to go on exchange in UNSW next semester and I can't wait to immerse myself in their culture and experience the unique teaching styles they offer. 

🔎 My interests lie in cybersecurity, cloud programming, and AI. Really excited to see what more AI can achieve in the future and how it may potentially affect our lives.

My Study Notes
======
📝 When I study for a topic, I like to write notes for different modules. Most of school slides are long and messy, thus writing notes makes it a lot clearer and easy to understand. I have uploaded some of my notes below for my own revision and if anyone needs it. 

**Software Engineering**

This course aims to equip students with foundation knowledge on issues and techniques required for the design and implementation of quality software. You will learn how to choose a suitable software process model for the development of a software system, how to engineer quality software using the Agile methods and techniques, Agile project management, scaling Agile methods, and other Agile techniques (e.g., Scrum). You will also learn requirements engineering, software design concepts and basic software testing strategies.

Certificates
======
Participated in Capture The Flag hosted by DSTA Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp. In the camp, we learnt about different operating systems, types of cybersecurity threats (Social Engineering, Ransomware, DDos, Cryptojacking) and ways to protect our data from intruders such as using Cryptology.
