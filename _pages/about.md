👩🏻‍💻 I am a year 3 Infomation Engineering and Media student in Nanyang Technological University.

🐨 I'm currently waiting to go on exchange in UNSW next semester and I can't wait to immerse myself in their culture and experience the unique teaching styles they offer. 

🔎 My interests lie in cybersecurity, cloud programming, and AI. Really excited to see what more AI can achieve in the future and how it may potentially affect our lives.

My Study Notes
======
📝 When I study for a topic, I like to write notes for different modules. Most of school slides are long and messy, thus writing notes makes it a lot clearer and easy to understand. I have uploaded some of my notes below for my own revision and if anyone needs it.
