Semester 1
=====

**Introduction to Data Science and Artifical Intelligence (IE0005)**

In this module, we learnt about the different data types and ways to represent them through plotting of graphs in python. Furthermore, the module taught us about various machine learnings tools to train and test our data and analyse the accuracy of our applied module. At the end of the module, everyone will be required to do a project and mine is accessible [here.](https://h-wenxuan.github.io/aboutme/portfolio/cardiovascularprediction/)

Semester 2
=====

**Software Engineering (IE4001)**

This module teaches us about how to choose suitable software process model for the development of a software system. It also covers Structural Modeling, which focuses on representing the structure of information, and Behavioral Modeling, which delves into the details of processes. Additionally, we explored the Web Engineering Process Framework, focusing on the modeling of processes, particularly in analysis and design. The module also includes Software Project Management, where we learnt about optimal team structures for various scenarios and the different metrics used to track and measure project progress.
