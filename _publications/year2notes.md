Semester 1
=====

**Introduction to Data Science and Artifical Intelligence (IE0005)**

In this module, we learnt about the different data types and ways to represent them through plotting of graphs in python. Furthermore, the module taught us about various machine learnings tools to train and test our data and analyse the accuracy of our applied module. At the end of the module, everyone will be required to do a project and mine is accessible [here.](https://h-wenxuan.github.io/aboutme/portfolio/cardiovascularprediction/)

**Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (IE2108)**

In this important module, we learnt about the different types of sorting methods and the time efficiency of each of them. Furthermore, we also learnt about abstract data types such as stacks and queue and binary search trees, as well as graphs. However, the most important concepts would be breadth-first search and depth-first search, as well as Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s Algorithm which are the different ways a code can search through a variety of nodes.

**Signals and Systems (IE2110)**

This module allows us to learn about the task of processing, modulating and transmitting the signal, as well as the properties of systems. Discrete-Time and Continuous-Time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems are important as we study their properties and the correlation between them. Another big chapter in this module is also the Fourier Series and Transform where a lot of calculations are involved. Nyquist Sampling Rate and Modulation are also covered.

**Engineering Math 1 (IE2106)**

Concepts include: Probability, Statistics (Poisson and Binomial Distribution, Hypothesis Testing), Nonlinear Equations, Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, Laplace Transform, Partial Differential Equations.

Semester 2
=====

**Software Engineering (IE4001)**

This module teaches us about how to choose suitable software process model for the development of a software system. It also covers Structural Modeling, which focuses on representing the structure of information, and Behavioral Modeling, which delves into the details of processes. Additionally, we explored the Web Engineering Process Framework, focusing on the modeling of processes, particularly in analysis and design. The module also includes Software Project Management, where we learnt about optimal team structures for various scenarios and the different metrics used to track and measure project progress.

**Computer Communications (IE3017)**

This module helped me gain a deeper understanding of how the network around us has worked. We touched on the TCP/IP model and mainly what the functions of the physical, link, network and transport layer does. It is a very useful and interesting topic as we learn how a WIFI connection is made and how information is sent in the form of packets from one computer to another. This topic is also useful in the cybersecurity industry when learning about how attackers want to intercept or monitor packets that are transmitting from one end to another.

**Engineering Math 2 (IE2107)**

Concepts include: Matrices (Determinants of Matrices, Elementary Matrices, Diagonalisation of Matrices), Complex Numbers (Limit and Continuity of complex numbers), Analytic Functions, Complex Integration, Vectors (Divergence, Curl, Flux).
