Semester 2
=====
**Digital Electronics (IE2104)**
The module taught us about the number system (Binary, Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal) and the different forms of binary that exist. First part of the module is about digital Logic gates with PMOS and NMOS transistors, circuit manipulation and K-maps that are used to represent min and maxterm boolean Expression. Second part of the module, we delve deeper into Programmable Logic Devices, as well as Binary Encoders and Decoders.

**Analog Electronics (IM1002)**
In Analog Electronic, we learn about how to analyse currents and voltages in a circuit with resistors and inductors. The most important 2 concepts that we should grasp are Kirchhoffâ€™s Current and Voltage Law as it simplifies circuit analysis. Furthermore, Laplace Transform and Inverse Laplace Transforms are also important concepts that are covered in this module. Op-amps, diodes and Bipolar Junction Transistors are also taught in these modules and are equally important as well.

**Mathematics 2 (MH1811)**
Concepts include: 2D and 3D graphs, Limits and Path Limits, Partial Derivatives, Directional Derivatives, Lagrange Multiplier method, Taylor and Maclaurin Series, Differential Equations.
